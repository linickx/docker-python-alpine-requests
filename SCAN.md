# Security vulnerability scanner (for container) report.

This docker image and packages are not pinned to any version, as such the repository doesn't change and the vulnerabilities present are based on the build time.

To help give users and idea of what the latest dockerhub build/images looks like, this report is produced.

The scanner uses [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype/) within a [Github Scan Action](https://github.com/anchore/scan-action)
